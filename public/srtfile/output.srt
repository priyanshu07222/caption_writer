00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When I worked in the factory

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in Mexico, it was Mother's

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Day, okay? Or Mother's Day,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I had the job with the

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
staff of giving roses to all

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the women who were mothers,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and I didn't know anything

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
about the meaning of the word

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
a mother in Mexico. So, I

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
would go around telling them

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
or asking them, are you a

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
mother? Okay, I should have

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
said, are you a mother? But

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
no, I said, are you a mother?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And Eduardo came and told me,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
no, don't say, you are a

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
mother, it is not nice at all,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
you are a mother, you are a

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
mother?
