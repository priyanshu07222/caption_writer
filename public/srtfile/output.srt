00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
"'When I worked in the factory

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
in Mexico, it was Mother's

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Day, okay? Or Mother's Day,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and I had the job with the

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
staff of giving roses to all

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the women who were mothers,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I didn't know anything

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
about the meaning of the word

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
a mother in Mexico. So, I

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
would go around telling them

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or asking them, are you a

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
mother? Okay, I should have

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
said, are you a mother? But

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
no, I said, are you a mother?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And Eduardo came and told me,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
no, don't say, you are a

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
mother, it is not nice at all,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you are one'."
